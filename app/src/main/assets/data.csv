The Great Wall|the_great_wall.jpg|The?Great Wall of China is a series of?fortifications?that were built across the historical northern borders of?ancient Chinese states?and?Imperial China?as protection against?various nomadic groups?from the?Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century?BC,[2]?with selective stretches later joined together by?Qin Shi Huang?(220¨C206?BC), the first emperor of China.

Derivative|derivative.png|The?derivative?of a?function of a real variable?measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its?argument?(input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of?calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to?time?is the object's?velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.|difficulty: hard, language: chinese|Math, Physics, Chemistry|
Function|function.jpg|In?mathematics, a?function?is a?binary relation?between two?sets?that associates each element of the first set to exactly one element of the second set.

World War II|world_war_ii.jpg|World War?II?or the?Second World War, often abbreviated as?WWII?or?WW2, was a?global war?that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved?the vast majority of the world's countries¡ªincluding all of the?great powers¡ªforming two opposing?military alliances: the?Allies?and the?Axis powers. In a?total war?directly involving more than 100?million?personnel?from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the?war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources.?Aircraft played a major role?in the conflict, enabling the?strategic bombing?of population centres and the only two uses of?nuclear weapons?in war to this day.

Isolationism|isolationism.jpg|Isolationism?is a category of?foreign policies?institutionalized by leaders who assert that nations' best interests are best served by keeping the affairs of other countries at a distance. One possible motivation for limiting international involvement is to avoid being drawn into dangerous and otherwise undesirable conflicts.

Kinematics|kinematics.jpg|"Kinematics?is a subfield of physics, developed in?classical mechanics, that describes the?motion?of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move.?Kinematics, as a field of study, is often referred to as the ""geometry of motion"" and is occasionally seen as a branch of mathematics.?A kinematics problem begins by describing the geometry of the system and declaring the initial conditions of any known values of position, velocity and/or acceleration of points within the system. Then, using arguments from geometry, the position, velocity and acceleration of any unknown parts of the system can be determined."|difficulty: easy, language: chinese|Physics|
Newton's Laws of Motion|newtons_laws.jpg|In?classical mechanics,?Newton's laws of motion?are three?laws?that describe the relationship between the?motion?of an object and the?forces?acting on it. The first law states that an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant?velocity, unless it is acted upon by an external?force.[1]?The second law states that the rate of change of?momentum?of an object is directly proportional to the force applied, or, for an object with constant mass, that the net?force?on an object is equal to the?mass?of that object multiplied by the?acceleration. The third law states that when one object exerts a force on a second object, that second object exerts a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first object.|difficulty: medium, language: chinese|Physics|
